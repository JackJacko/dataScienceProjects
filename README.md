# dataScienceProjects
This repository contains a series of python-based Guided Projects made as part of the Data Scientist curriculum on [Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/).

In detail:
- *Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQLite and Python*: this project explores SQLite Version 3 and how it can be used to query data from a database.
- *Answering Business Questions using SQL*: this project uses SQLite Version 3 to operate complex queries on a database. The extracted data is used to analyse business metrics in a fictional scenario.
- *Designing and Creating an SQL Database*: this project explores the process of designing and creating a database. Specifically, SQLite Version 3 is used to construct a database of baseball statistics from several datasets containing data on games, players, teams, ballparks, etc.
- *Creating a Kaggle Workflow*: this project aims to construct a streamlined machine learning workflow for cyclic exploration, engineering and selection of features and models with the goal of maximising predictive performance.
- *Explore U.S. Births*: this project uses a dataset of US births statistics to explore the concept of custom function definitions in Python.
- *Exploring Gun Deaths in the US*: this project is an exercise in data analysis and visualisation made using a dataset of gun-related deaths statistics.
- *Investigating Airplane Accidents*: this project is an exercise in data retrieval with the specific goal of exploring the concept of time complexity.
- *Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings*: this project aims to use statistics and significance testing to determine whether a popular movie ratings website changed its rating system after promising to do a few years back.
- *NYC High School Data Analysis*: this project is an exercise in data analysis and visualisation made using a dataset of New York City high school statistics.
- *Predicting Bike Rentals*: this project aims to use machine learning with the goal of predicting next-hour bike rental numbers based on a dataset of bike rental statistics for Washington DC.
- *Predicting Car Prices*: this project aims to use a KNeighbours Regressor to predict optimal car sale prices based on a dataset of used car listings. The procedure includes feature engineering and selection and hyperparameter optimisation.
- *Predicting House Sale Prices*: this project aims to use machine learning to predict optimal car sale prices based on a dataset of house sale listings. The procedure includes feature engineering and selection and hyperparameter optimisation.
- *Predicting Loan Default*: this project aims to use machine learning to develop a model capable of predicting whether a loan is likely to default or not before being funded. The goal is for the model to maximise gain (true positives) while keeping losses (false positives) below the threshold corresponding to randomly picking loans to be funded.
- *Predicting the Stock Market*: this project aims to use machine learning to develop a model capable of predicting the daily closing price of the S&P 500 index using data on past performance of the index. A system is also put in place to retrieve updated S&P 500 data from the Internet and to predict tomorrow's closing price.
- *Refining Model Accuracy*: a companion project to *Creating a Kaggle Workflow*, aimed at using machine learning to predict whether a test dataset of RMS Titanic passengers survived or perished in the sinking of the ship.
- *Star Wars Data Analysis*: this project is an exercise in data analysis and visualisation made using the results of a Star Wars-related survey.
- *Winning Jeopardy*: this project aims to determine whether it is possible to use patterns and repetitions in a dataset of Jeopardy questions to to gain a winning edge in the game.

NOTE: The actual datasets on which the code runs are not provided since I don't own any of them.
